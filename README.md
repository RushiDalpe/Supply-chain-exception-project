Supply Chain Exceptions Analysis

Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain exception data to identify delivery delays, reasons for delays, and their impact on operations. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve supply chain efficiency.

Dataset
The dataset contains shipment details such as planned and actual delivery days, delay flags, delay reasons, forecasted and actual units shipped, and cost impact.

Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

Key Analysis & Visualizations
- Distribution of delivery delays and delay reasons
- Trends in average delivery delay over time
- 7-day moving average to smooth delay trends
- Summary report highlighting recent changes in delivery performance

How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Supply-chain-exception-project.ipynb`) to explore the step-by-step analysis.
2. Modify the code to apply on your own supply chain datasets.

Insights & Recommendations
- Delivery delays have been identified and quantified.
- Recent trends show whether delays are improving or worsening.
- Recommendations include focusing on recent causes of delay to improve efficiency.
